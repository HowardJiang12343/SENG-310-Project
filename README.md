## Quality Assurance Analysis

HealFood APP meets the requirements for some groups of people who are busy but want to have healthy food. This APP target mainly for people who don't like cooking but want healthy food and for people who love cooking but lack proper advice on control calories.

However, from the perspective of the user, this APP only covers limited categories of food and does not contain all kinds of foods that the user wants. That's to say, HealFood still needs to create more various food choices to meet the expectation of users. From the perspective of software, HealFood needs to apply a more up-to-date concept on constructing the interface. For example, people need a more obvious and convenient label to help them do a simple operation.
